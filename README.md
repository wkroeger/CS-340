Client/Server Development


•How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

By using common terms for object variables, such as “query,” “idNumber,” etc., and including comments and explanations, the code I developed for my projects can be applied to other databases as a CRUD layer to perform database queries. The CRUD module I developed could be adapted to be used in other MongoDB databases.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I try to develop a high-level plan and overview of what I want to accomplish. Depending on the complexity of the work, I might develop a small pseudocode workflow or basic block diagram of how I imagine the finished product will work. If there are requirements that need to be met, I make sure to reference them frequently to ensure I meet all the requirements as I develop a plan forward. My approach for the dashboard required that I learn how to develop different pieces of the dashboard, but also the specific naming conventions used for each animal and testing to ensure that the dashboard sorted data correctly.
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientists work to understand what is possible with computers by understanding how computers work. The modern world would look different without computers because computers have been one of the largest driving forces in productivity and innovation for nearly every industry on Earth. My work on this project in particular allowed me to sort through massive amounts of data to find very specific items and display them in a user-friendly way so that even people with very little computer experience could use the dashboard to find detailed information quickly and easily. This amplifies the amount of work that one person can perform by performing the otherwise tedious task of finding each animal individually.
